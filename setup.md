## Remote Desktop Client 

In this workshop we will be using remote desktops that come pre-configured with all the
resources you will need to complete the course. Prior to that you will need to download
the windows remote desktop client suitable for your operating system.

Link to Microsoft's website, please use the table to pick the link to the app appropriate to your system:
Note: For Windows users this is the microsoft store.

[Remote Desktop Clients](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/remote/remote-desktop-services/clients/remote-desktop-clients)

The remote desktop will be available to you for the time allocated to your workshop 
and potentially include some 'out of hours' time.

During the course we will have time dedicated to helping you install the software on 
your own computer so afterwards you can continue to use the skills you have learnt.

### Connecting to your remote desktop

1. Login to Microsoft Teams using your University account. 
2. Navigate to the team (Request to join the team if you are not already a member).
3. Register for the lab using the provided link, the registration link will be emailed and in the teams channel, register with the same account you use for Teams. You cannot proceed until you have registered.
4. Open the Azure Lab Services tab. The labs will start and stop automatically, don't worry if it is currently stopped.
![Azure Lab Tab](fig/setup-lab-tab.png)
6. You need to copy your RDP information click the three dots in the lower right corner.
![RDP Info](fig/setup-rdp-info.png)
7. You will be prompted to copy the remote desktop information copy it to your clipboard.
8. Open your remote desktop app that we installed earlier.
9. Click on the + and select Add PC, paste in the RDP information. (Green highlights)

10. Optionally add the user account to the PC. The username is 'lab-user' the password is 'Qwerty2000'

Note: the Virtual computers will automatically start before the workshop and stop at the end. 
If you are inactive for more than 15 minutes, they will also switch off. They can be re-started from the Lab Services Tab
but this can take up to 5 minutes, and you may need to ask the instructor. Outside the sessions if you have been
allocated additional time you may log in to your session and continue working.

# Best Practices in Data Organisation Using Spreadsheets

## Introduction to the Data for this Lesson ##
The data used in this lesson comes from a project observing a small mammal community in southern
Arizona, US. This is part of a project studying the effects of rodents and ants on the plant
community that has been running for almost 40 years. The rodents are sampled on a series of 24 plots,
with different experimental manipulations controlling which rodents are allowed to access which plots.
This is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. It is published at [Ecological Archives](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E090/118/) and can be found on [Portal Project Database](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData). This data is open and free to use for research purposes.

> ## For Interest Only: Portal Project Teaching Dataset
> [The Portal Project Teaching Database](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459) is a simplified version of the
> [Portal Project Database](https://github.com/weecology/PortalData) designed for teaching. It provides a real world example of life-history, population, and ecological data, with sufficient complexity to teach many aspects of data analysis and management, but with many complexities removed to allow students to focus on the core ideas and skills being taught. The database is currently available in csv, json, and sqlite formats.
>
> The Portal Project Teaching Database's GitHub repository can be found at: [https://github.com/weecology/portal-teachingdb](https://github.com/weecology/portal-teachingdb),
> where suggested changes or additions to this dataset can be requested or contributed.
> This database is not designed for research as it intentionally removes some of the real-world complexities. The Python code used for converting the original database to this teaching version can be found in [create_portal_teach_dataset.py](https://github.com/weecology/portal-teachingdb/blob/master/create_portal_teaching_dataset.py).

## Download Data for Spreadsheets Lesson ##

For the purposes of training, this data has been simplified a bit (you can still download the full dataset and work with it using exactly the same tools we will learn here). This simplified version of data is available from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459). In this lesson, you will need to download the following five files from the [Portal Project Teaching Dataset](http://figshare.com/articles/Portal_Project_Teaching_Database/1314459):
-  [messy_survey_data.xls](data/messy_survey_data.xlsx) - this is the main file we will work with. It includes messy survey data
(in Excel's `.xlsx` format) that you will clean during the lesson and use to learn some best practices in
data organisation.
- [surveys.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/2292172) - the cleaned survey data
    Fields: `record_id`, `month`, `day`, `year`, `plot_id`, `species_id`, `sex`, `hindfoot_length`, `weight`
- [plots.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299474) - clean information on plot number and type
    Fields: `plot_id`, `plot_type`
- [species.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/3299483) - clean information on species codes and scientific names
    Fields: `species_id`, `genus`, `species`, `taxa`
- [combined.csv](https://ndownloader.figshare.com/files/10717186) - clean data from surveys, plots and species data
files combined into one clean file (a good example of what a clean data file should look like)
Fields: `record_id`, `month`, `day`, `year`, `plot_id`, `species_id`, `sex`, `hindfoot_length`, `weight`, `genus`,
`species`, `taxa`, `plot_type`


## Install Excel ##

Excel is commonly provided by most institutions via the Microsoft Office suite via an instututional licence. 
On Windows and Mac Excel can be downloaded using Microsoft Store or the App Store. 
On Linux systems you can use Excel in a browser (not reccomended) or use an alterntive such as LibreOffice.
If you do not have acess to a Microsoft offive licence then please see the LibreOffice installation instructions.


## Install LibreOffice ##

To interact with spreadsheets, you can use various software - for example Microsoft Excel,
LibreOffice, Gnumeric, OpenOffice.org, Google Spreadsheets. Commands may differ a bit between programs,
but the general ideas for thinking about spreadsheets are the same.

For this lesson, if you do not have a spreadsheet program already, you can use a free and open source tool
[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/libreoffice-fresh/)
as it can open Excel spreadsheets, which is the format of the data we will work with during the lesson
(also all examples used refer to Excel).

# Data Cleaning with OpenRefine

## Download Data for OpenRefine Lesson ##

The Portal Project Teaching Dataset is a real dataset that has been used in over 100 publications. We have simplified it
for the purposes of this lesson, but you can download the full dataset (see below for details) and work with it
using exactly the same tools we will learn here.

For this lesson, you will need to download the following file (remember where you downloaded the file!):
*  [portal_project_rodents.csv](data/portal_project_rodents.csv)

Data in some of the columns of the above file (e.g. `geolocation`, `locality`, `county`, `country`, `JSON`) are contrived for the purpose of the lessons and are in no way related to the original dataset.

## Install OpenRefine ##

For this lesson you will need [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) (formerly GoogleRefine) and a web browser.
Download the most recent version of [OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/download.html) for your operating system,
then follow the instructions below.

[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org/) is a Java program that runs locally on your machine (i.e. you are not accessing a remote service on the Internet). 
OpenRefine for Mac come with embedded Java, on Windows please select Windows kit with embedded Java, on Linux you will need to install Java separately.

Once it is running on your machine, you access it via your browser at the address [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). No Internet connection is needed for this as the programme is running locally.

### Windows
- If you have Internet Explorer (or Edge) set as your default web browser, check that you have Firefox or Chrome installed and set either of them as your default browser. OpenRefine runs in your default browser, but may not run correctly in Internet Explorer. You can check how to set your browser as default for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB) or [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser).
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory by right-clicking and selecting `Extract...`. Name that directory something like OpenRefine.
- Locate `openrefine.exe` in the extracted folder and launch OpenRefine by double-clicking on it. This will launch a command prompt window first.
- Wait for OpenRefine to launch in your default Web browser, which is where you will interact with the program. If this does not happen, head to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your Web browser of choice.

### Mac

- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browser installed and set as your default browser. You can check how to set your browser as default for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB) or [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser).
- Locate the downloaded `.dmg` file and Ctrl-click it. You may get the warning "macOS cannot verify the developer of “OpenRefine.app”. Are you sure you want to open it?" Click 'Yes'/'Open' to this.
- Drag `OpenRefine.app` into your Applications folder, and Ctrl-click to open it. You may get the warning "macOS cannot verify the developer of “OpenRefine.app”. Are you sure you want to open it?" Click 'Yes'/'Open' to this.
- Wait for OpenRefine to launch in your default Web browser, which is where you will interact with the program. If this does not happen, head to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your Web browser of choice.

### Linux

- This requires Java to be installed on your computer. If you do not already have it, download [OpenJDK Java](https://openjdk.java.net/).
- Check that you have Firefox or Chrome browser installed and set as your default browser. You can check how to set your browser as default for [Google Chrome](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95417?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en-GB) or [Firefox](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/make-firefox-your-default-browser).
- Unzip the downloaded file into a directory. Go to this directory from terminal and type ./refine to start.
- Wait for OpenRefine to launch in your default Web browser, which is where you will interact with the program. If this does not happen, head to [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333) in your Web browser of choice.

## Text Editor ##

A text editor is the piece of software you use to view and write code. If you
have a preferred text editor, please use it. Suggestions for text editors are,
Notepad++ (Windows), TextEdit (macOS), Gedit (GNU/Linux), GNU Nano, Vim.
Alternatively, there are IDE's (integrated developer environments) that have
more features specifically for coding such as VS Code; there are also IDEs
specific to languages will be listed in the appropriate section(s) below.

# Managing Academic Software Development

## GitHub ##
We'll be using the website [GitHub](https://github.com/) to host, back up, and distribute our code. You'll need to [create an account there](https://github.com/signup). As your GitHub username will appear in the URLs of your projects there, it's best to use a short, clear version of your name if you can.


## Project Demo Repository

We'll be showing you how to manage an example academic software project. 
If you've completed our **Version Control with git** workshop, you'll have a finished version of our `climate-analysis` repository ([you'll have used the template from here](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/git-novice-template/))
If not, please [create a copy of it from this template (linked here)](https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/project-novice-template/generate), and name it `climate-analysis`.


## Install Visual Studio Code

This workshop involves editing code files. 
Whilst you can use any text editor to do this, some code editors or Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) have features designed to make coding easier.
If you're already using a code editor or IDE (e.g. [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) or [Spyder](https://www.spyder-ide.org/)), 
stick with what you're comfortable with. If not, we'd recommend installing [Visual Studio Code (link here)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Windows / MacOS
Go to [the Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and download and run the installer.

### Linux
If you're on **Ubuntu**, Visual Studio Code should be available through the software centre! 
If not, [follow the detailed instructions here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux) to install it.


# The Bash Shell

## Open a Terminal ##

For this lesson, first you need to be able to open a terminal:

- **On Windows:** run "Git Bash", to install git bash go here [https://gitforwindows.org/](https://gitforwindows.org/) click download and select 'Git-X.XX.X-64-bit.exe' from the assets list.
- **On Mac OS X:** accessed by opening the “Terminal” application, which can be found in the “Utilities” folder which is in your “Applications” folder.
- **On Linux:** this will depend on the Linux distribution you are running, but you should be able to find a "Terminal" application in your desktop's application menu.



## Git Setup ##

### Windows
We'll be using Git Bash for both git and a shell to run it in. If you've already installed Git Bash then go to the next section. Otherwise, go to [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and click **Download**, then install it. 
Most of the options can be left on default, but be sure you check these:

- **Choosing the default editor used by Git:** Make sure **Nano** is selected from the drop-down. If you're comfortable with other editors, feel free to change it, but we recommend Nano - we use it as it's present on Windows, Mac *and* Linux. If you change it, you might not quite match what we're doing on-screen.
- **Adjusting your PATH environment:** Make sure **Git from the command line and also from 3rd-party software** is selected.
- **Choosing HTTPS transport backend:** Make sure **Use the native Windows Secure Channel Library** is selected.
- **Configuring the terminal emulator to use with Git Bash:** Make sure **Use Windows' default console window** is selected.

#### Mac OS
To use Git you must install the Apple Command Line Tools, this may take a few minutes.  

You can obtain these [from Apple](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?name=command%20line%20tools%20for%20xcode%2012) (requires your Apple ID)

- Select **Command Line Tools for Xcode 12 (or higher)** and click the link to download the dmg archive.
- If prompted, choose to allow downloads from developer.apple.com
- Open the downloaded dmg archive from the Downloads folder
- Double-click the Command Line Tools.pkg icon to install

Alternatively, you can install the tools from the command line:

~~~
$ xcode-select --install
~~~
{: .language-bash}

#### Linux
Git comes pre-installed on most Linux distributions. You can test if it's installed by running `git --version`. 
If it's not installed, you can install it by running `sudo apt-get install git` or `sudo yum install git`, depending on 
your distribution.


## Download Data for Shell Lesson ##

Type the following into the prompt that appears (pressing enter/return after each line):

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone https://github.com/Southampton-RSG-Training/shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

`cd` will move to your home directory, and `git clone` will download a copy of the materials.

Alternatively, if you have SSH authentication with GitHub enabled (if you don't know what this means don't worry, it is covered in the Git SWC course if you want to know more!) you can use the following:

~~~
$ cd
$ git clone git@github.com:Southampton-RSG-Training/shell-novice.git
~~~
{: .language-bash}

This should download all the content for the lesson to a new directory.
Please let the instructors know if you run into any problems.
